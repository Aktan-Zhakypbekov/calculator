Well, from this project I learned that a software development process is a mess. If you are not considerate and attentive from
the very beginning of the process, the project very quickly gets messy.
Also, I learned that there are many ways of solving one problem. I looked at other people's solutions and feel guilty that my
code isn't as good as theirs. My code is messy, lengthy, incomprehensible, and complicated. I must learn to write clean and simple code. But, for the time being I am learning to write code at all. I am proud that I am not copying code and instead inventing my own methods and solutions although they are not as effective and clean as I would like them to be. I have to train more.
Next, up untill this moment I was making project for fun and concentrating on the fun part only. But now, I must begin making projects concentrating on time and efficiency as I am leveling up.
Also, learn to plan and think.
